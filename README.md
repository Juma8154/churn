Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and 
investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data 
visualization methods.
It helps determine how best to manipulate data sources to get the 
answers you need, making it easier for data scientists to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check 
assumptions.
EDA is primarily used to see what data can reveal beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task and provides a better understanding of data set variables and the relationships between them.
It can also help determine if the statistical techniques you are considering for data analysis are appropriate
